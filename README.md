# Cpp Ncurses Maze Game

This game was an university assignment in which we had to create a C++ maze game with the [Ncurses library](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) and is called **Conviction of Mpampis Potereides**.

You can run this game under any OS which has installed `make` and `ncurses library`, if so you can simply run `make` inside of the root of the repository.
